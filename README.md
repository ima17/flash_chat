<h1>flashChat - A real-time chat application built with Flutter and Firebase</h1>

<p>This repository contains the source code for a chat application called flashChat. The application is built using Flutter, a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. The backend is powered by Firebase, which provides real-time database, authentication, and storage services.</p>

<p>The application allows users to sign up or log in to the chat and start conversations with other users in real-time. 
</p>
<p>The code in this repository is open-source and can be used as a starting point for building your own chat application or for learning Flutter and Firebase development. Feel free to use, modify, and distribute the code however you like.
</p>
<h1>## Getting Started</h1>
<p>To get started with this project, you will need to set up a Firebase project and configure the Flutter application to use your Firebase project. Instructions for setting up a Firebase project and configuring the Flutter application can be found in the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup).
</p>

<p>Once you have set up Firebase, you can clone the repository and run the following commands to install the dependencies and run the application:
<ul>
  <li>$ git clone https://github.com/[username]/flashChat.git</li>
  <li>$ cd flashChat</li>
